# Matrix-Magiq Infrastructure

This directory contains essential reference files from the Polkadot and Substrate repositories needed for the Matrix-Magiq parachain deployment.

## Directory Structure

- polkadot_essentials/: Key files extracted from the Polkadot repository
- substrate_essentials/: Key files extracted from the Substrate repository

## Integration with Matrix-Magiq

The parachain implementation in NRSH, ELXR, and IMRT rely on these infrastructure components through:

1. Shared configuration files
2. Runtime implementation patterns
3. Parachain specification templates

## Error Correction

The error correction implementation for Matrix-Magiq follows the three-layer approach:

1. Classical Error Correction: Reed-Solomon codes for traditional data protection
2. Bridge Error Correction: Interface protection for classical-quantum communication
3. Quantum Error Correction: Surface codes for quantum state protection

These components are integrated in the integration/error_correction directory.
