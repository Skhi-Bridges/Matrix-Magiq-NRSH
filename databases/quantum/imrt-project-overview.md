# Comprehensive Documentation Requirements for NRSH, ELXR, and NeuraSphere Projects

## Overview of Projects

Based on the conversation history, you have three main blockchain projects being prepared for submission to both the Blockchain for Good Alliance (BGA) and Polkadot:

1. **NRSH (Nourish Chain)** - A parachain focused on spirulina production tracking and distribution
2. **ELXR (Elixir Chain)** - A parachain focused on kombucha production and makeup applications
3. **NeuraSphere (VQC)** - A revolutionary parachain enabling hardware-free computation through subspace technology

Each project requires a comprehensive set of documentation to complete successful applications to both BGA and Polkadot.

## Pallet Structure Notes

### NRSH and ELXR Pallets

Both NRSH and ELXR appear to operate with standard Substrate pallets. The documentation doesn't specifically enumerate all pallets, but the Smart Contract Framework covers the necessary functionality.

### NeuraSphere (VQC) Pallets

NeuraSphere requires five specialized pallets:

1. **Subspace Computation Pallet** - Manages computational resources
2. **Natural Interface Pallet** - Handles voice/text/video inputs
3. **Visualization Pallet** - Controls holographic and conventional displays
4. **EigenLayer Integration Pallet** - Manages restaking mechanisms
5. **Frequency Allocation Pallet** - Manages the frequency-wavelength system

All five pallets are covered in the Technical Whitepaper, Smart Contract Framework, and Treasury Proposal.
