# Matrix-Magiq Quantum Runtime

A quantum circuit optimizer and analyzer powered by Google's Gemini AI.

## Features

- Quantum circuit optimization using Gemini AI
- Error rate analysis and recommendations
- Support for common quantum gates (H, CNOT, X, etc.)
- Asynchronous operation for better performance

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set your Gemini API key:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the quantum runtime:
```bash
python quantum_runtime.py
```

The runtime will:
1. Create an example quantum circuit
2. Get optimization suggestions from Gemini
3. Analyze error rates and provide recommendations
4. Log the results

## Example Output

The output will include:
- Circuit optimization suggestions
- Gate reduction recommendations
- Error mitigation strategies
- Qubit layout optimization tips
- Error rate analysis and improvements
