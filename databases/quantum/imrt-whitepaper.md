## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Hardware Problem

The global demand for computational power continues to grow exponentially, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, data analytics, and scientific research. This demand has led to unsustainable practices:

- Mining of rare earth minerals and precious metals under questionable labor conditions
- Manufacturing processes that generate significant pollution
- Global e-waste crisis with millions of tons of electronic waste each year
- Uneven distribution of computational resources favoring wealthy economies

### 1.2 The IMRT - Immortality Blockchain Solution

IMRT - Immortality Blockchain eliminates these problems by shifting computation entirely into subspaceâ€”a dimensional layer that exists parallel to physical reality but requires no material substrate. Through this breakthrough approach, we enable:

- Universal access to computational resources without hardware dependencies
- Zero environmental impact from manufacturing or disposal
- Democratized access across economic barriers
- Infinitely scalable resources limited only by frequency allocation
