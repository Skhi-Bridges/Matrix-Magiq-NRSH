# Qudit Operational Circuits and Extended Capabilities

## 1. Quaternary Logic Circuit Designs

### 1.1 Quaternary Adder Circuit

The quaternary adder processes two qudit inputs (a and b) to produce a sum output (s) and carry output (c). Each adder stage implements:

```

```

The circuit utilizes three primary components:

Implementation requires quaternary multiplexers that select outputs based on input state combinations.

### 1.2 Quaternary Multiplier Circuit
