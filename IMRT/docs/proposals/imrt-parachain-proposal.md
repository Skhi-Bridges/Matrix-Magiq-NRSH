# Virtual Quantum Computer (IMRT) Parachain Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal presents the Virtual Quantum Computer (IMRT) parachain, a revolutionary computing paradigm that eliminates the need for physical hardware entirely. By implementing computation in subspace through the Polkadot ecosystem, IMRT will democratize access to advanced computing capabilities through intuitive natural language interfaces and holographic displays. The IMRT parachain will dramatically reduce the environmental impact of computing by eliminating hardware production, e-waste, and energy consumption, while simultaneously providing universal access to quantum-inspired computational capabilities.

The innovative tokenomics model allocates 27% of the frequency utilization fees to the intellectual property creator, ensuring sustainable funding for continued innovation while maintaining reasonable costs for users. Through deep integration with EigenLayer, the IMRT parachain creates a unique capital-efficient mechanism that allows computational resources to be restaked across the ecosystem.

IMRT represents a paradigm shift in computingâ€”moving beyond physical constraints to create a new Eden of digital abundance where advanced computation is available to all without environmental harm or excessive cost.

## The Challenge: Hardware Dependencies and Environmental Impact

The current computing paradigm faces several critical challenges:

                }
                
                // Distribute fees
                let creator_fee = payment * self.creator_fee_percentage as u128 / 100;
                let validator_fee = payment * self.validator_fee_percentage as u128 / 100;

                // Transfer fees to respective accounts
                self.env().transfer(self.ip_creator, creator_fee).unwrap_or_default();
                // Other transfers would happen here
                
                band.reserved = true;
                band.owner = Some(caller);
                self.total_fees_collected += payment;
                
                true
            } else {
                false
            }
